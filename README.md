# strabomap_backend
This is the back-end which now uses https://github.com/RinseWillet/strabomap_db as a repository container. It is set-up to specifically serves data on ancient Roman cities in Asia Minor (see also https://www.equinoxpub.com/home/geography-urbanism/). I added a small excel-sheet which shows an example of the type of data it can serve from the postgresql/postgis database.

Made mostly with the Spring Boot framework, it was heavily inspired by and based off this tutorial : https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/getting-started-building-location-based-gis-rest-apis-with-java-ca28a8869af3 and this code: https://github.com/The-Code-Mastery/gis-rest-api-with-java/
